This file is for things todo, and ideas I have for RBSH

Feel free to contribute to this!


# TODO
- [ ] Make RBSH fully async, or just make performance really good
- [ ] Make RBSH code much cleaner
- [ ] Improve `install.sh`
- [ ] Make the `config.yml` cleaner
- [ ] Make `config.yml` settings not all be required and
- [ ] Remove `colorama` and use `prompt_toolkit.print_formated_text` (Requires rewrite of the function(s) in `utils/prompt.py`)


# IDEAS
- Seperate the `utils/__init__.py` into more files
