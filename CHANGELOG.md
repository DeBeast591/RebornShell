# Changelog

## 0.0.1 - Initial Commit
Just a skeleton of the Shell

## 0.1 - Not a skeleton anymore
**Added:**
- The actual shell
- A basic configuration
- History + history suggestions (like ZSH/Fish)
- Vim CoC-like autocomplete
- An `install.sh` file
  - Just installs the `pip3` requirements.

**Known Bugs:**
- History file doesn't use the correct location, and always makes `rbsh_history` file in the current directory.
